"Hello World" project of first learning tensorflow. If you are a beginner who is not familiar with machine learning and TensorFlow, you could try these code and have fun :)

## MNIST
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits, and you can use 'input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True)' to simply get the data. The input data is a list of the array, each of the input is 28x28 = 784 size vector, and the labels are in one-hot type, which looks like '[0, 1, 0, ..., 0]' if the label is 1.
